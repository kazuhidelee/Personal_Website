            Below is the collection of projects I've worked on during my academic journey!  
            My name is <p className="highlight"><strong>Tony</strong></p>, and Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the <Link ref={"https://umich.edu/"} text="University of Michigan"/>.  

            <br /><br />
            My journey into programming started later than most, but that didnâ€™t stop me from diving headfirst into hands-on experiences. Through internships, part-time jobs, and personal projects, Iâ€™ve built both **technical expertise** and **strong teamwork skills**â€”fueling my passion for developing solutions to real-world problems.  

            <br /><br />
            Beyond coding, my multicultural backgroundâ€”growing up in China, Korea, and Japanâ€”has shaped my adaptability and given me a **diverse perspective** on problem-solving. This ability to navigate different environments and viewpoints is something I bring to every team and project.  

            <br /><br />
            Outside of tech, I love curating **music playlists** and expressing creativity through **art** ðŸŽ¨.
